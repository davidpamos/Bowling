A coded experiment in the ISS to evaluate the astronauts' quality of life on board, under the Astro Pi project: Mission Space Lab.
1. Participants:
The team is made up of five first-year high school students:
   - Daniel Basile Funes.
   - Yussef El Hassani Chairi Kachaf.
   - Cristian Enrique Martínez.
   - Axier Jiménez Pacheco.
   - Francisco Javier Ortiz Ríos.
   - Francisco José Pérez Ortiz.
   - Mentor: David Pamos Ortega. Dpto. de Física y Química. IES Levante. Algeciras. Spain

2. Objective:
The main objective of the experiment is to check if there are vibrations in the ship that can be appreciable by the astronauts, and to evaluate their quality of life on board.

3. Method for achieving the objective:
The code measures acceleration, rotation, and orientation using the movement sensor IMU every 10 seconds. The date, time and coordinates of the ISS will also be recorded. We estimate that the data does not exceed about 2 megabytes of storage space.

4. Expected results:
We think that the orientation and rotation data will be stable, and there may be more oscillations in the acceleration values, but not very large.
